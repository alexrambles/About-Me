- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alexis! (@artabstraction)

- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently interested in creating datasets with web scrapers that can then be analyzed with excel or SQL.

- ğŸ“š I have a Bachelor's degree in Fine Arts and am attending a boot camp for Data Analytics.

- ğŸ’» I currently work as a freelance web developer, and I'm currently learning about game design and business analytics.

- ğŸŒ± My first computer language besides HTML/CSS was vanilla Javascript, but my first competant language was SQL!

- ğŸ“« You can usually reach me on twitter or via my email (alexis@alexisrichard.com).
