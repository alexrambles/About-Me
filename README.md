# Who am I?

## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alex!

I love to build things that I can use and that make my life easier in some way. I mostly use Python, and love creating automated processes. 

Currently I work as a Business Intelligence Developer in Marketing, but am constantly taking new courses to improve my ability with automation / workflow design / artificial intelligence.
